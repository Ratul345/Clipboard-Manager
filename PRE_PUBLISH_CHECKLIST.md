## ‚ö†Ô∏è Action Required Before Publishing

### 1. Update README.md (3 locations)

Replace placeholder URLs with your actual GitHub information:

**Line 13:** 
```markdown
# Current:
git clone <repository-url>

# Change to:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/clipboard-manager.git
```

**Line 31:**
```markdown
# Current:
[Releases](https://github.com/yourusername/clipboard-manager/releases)

# Change to:
[Releases](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/clipboard-manager/releases)
```

**Line 361:**
```markdown
# Current:
[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/yourusername/clipboard-manager/issues)

# Change to:
[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/clipboard-manager/issues)
```

### 2. Remove Development Folders (Optional but Recommended)

These folders are already in `.gitignore` but you may want to delete them locally:

- `.kiro/` - Contains internal Kiro IDE development specs (not needed for open source users)
- `myenv/` - Virtual environment (users will create their own)
- `data/` - User-generated data (if exists)
- `logs/` - Application logs (if exists)

**Command to remove:**
```cmd
rmdir /s /q .kiro
rmdir /s /q myenv
rmdir /s /q data
rmdir /s /q logs
```

### 3. Add LICENSE File

You mentioned MIT License in README but don't have a LICENSE file. Create one:

```

```

### 4. Optional: Add CONTRIBUTING.md

2. Create GitHub repository and push:
